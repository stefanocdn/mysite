              Stéphane Cedroni with his background and experience in and familiarity with the French and the American
              educational systems is an excellent tutor, especially for those students who are studying in the French
              educational system and hoping to pursue studies in the American system.
              He helped prepare our daughter for the math portion of the SAT as well as for the Math 2 SAT subject test.
              Beside working to improve our daughter's mastery of topics she had studied in the French Lycee curriculum,
              Stéphane worked with our daughter to make her proficient in certain topics on the SAT subject test that
              she had not yet come across in school.
              In addition, he spent time with her working on developing an efficient method and approach to answering
              SAT questions and dealing with the time constraints and pressure that is part of the standardized testing
              process (SAT, ACT...). Stéphane quickly built a rapport with our daughter and she enjoyed the sessions.
              He was insightful and adapted to our daughter's learning style. Ultimately, of course, it is results that
              counts and we were delighted with the excellent SAT and SAT subject scores that our daughter, who was
              accepted at a top Ivy League college, achieved. We unreservedly recommend Stéphane as a tutor to prepare a
              student for the standardized
              testing and, more generally, to help their overall understanding of mathematics.

              Stéphane Cedroni tutored me for my last three years of High School. While working with him I was able to
              raise my average from a 9/20 to a 16/20 and I went from hating Mathematics to actually enjoying them. I
              even picked a Math class in University, which I would have never imagined!
              During the period of time we worked together I felt that Stéphane was able to adapt his teaching process
              to my needs and my self-confidence grew rapidly.
              Thanks to Stéphane I was able to achieve all my academic goals and will always be very grateful to him.

              Stéphane is an excellent bilingual math tutor. He worked with my daughter from age 14 to 17. First, she
              was able to review concepts she had not consolidated and get up to pace with her classmates. She then
              obtained top grades for her last two years of high school.
              Stéphane is personable, patient and very well organized. His aim from day one is to help his students to
              gain confidence and progress. He gives clear explanations of mathematical concepts and allows them to
              practice and ask questions. He follows up and makes sure that students have understood and practice what
              they’ve seen with him. We highly recommend him.
