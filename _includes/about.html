  </div>
  <p>
    I am passionate about education and teaching. I have been tutoring students from 6th to 12th grade, as well
    as College students, in Mathematics and Physics for over 10 years.
  </p>
  <p>
    From 2018 to 2019, I taught Mathematics and Physics at the <a href="http://steiner.edu">Rudolf Steiner School</a> on
    the
    Upper East Side.
  </p>
  <p>
    I truly believe that I can make a big difference not only in a child's grades/results but also in his/her working
    techniques
    and overall confidence.
  </p>
  <p>
    I live with my wife El√©onore, our son Henri and baby girl Chiara on the Upper East Side.

    Please reach out with any questions you might have. I look forward to hearing from you and working together.
